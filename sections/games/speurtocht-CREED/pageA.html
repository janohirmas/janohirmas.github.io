A while ago, but not so long ago... <br> In fact, 6 CREED seminars ago... Or was it 7? 
<br> Anyway... Back then, someone came 2 present 2 us some interesting findings. They found a puzzle... <br> No! They gave a <span class="clueword">"puzzling" finding</span> about a strategy...
<br>
What was the name of that strategy? If you don't know how 2 write it. Look at how I write!

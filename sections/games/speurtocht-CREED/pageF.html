Got my museum's card a while ago... I want to go somewhere new... <br>
It is <span class="clueword"> not West</span> <br>
It is <span class="clueword"> the home country of yoga</span> <br>
It is <span class="clueword"> not a woman </span> <br>
It sounds like <span class="clueword"> ZIP </span> <br>
It is <span class="clueword"> not the real one </span> <br>

Where am I located? The clues tell you where and how to write it.

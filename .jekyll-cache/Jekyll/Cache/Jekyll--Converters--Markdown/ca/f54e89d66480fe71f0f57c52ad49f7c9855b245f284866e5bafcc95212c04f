I"é<p>Many of the hiring decisions are made by third parties. Head hunters or HR personnel select CVs of
potential candidates for a job that will be evaluated by others. When looking for candidates, one tries
to predict the potential performance of such candidate if they were hired. Naturally, if one has information
of the person that will evaluate the candidateâ€™s performance, this can be useful to make predictions
of the candidateâ€™s performance. In this study, we explore how evaluators rate workers of which they
have different pieces of information (including gender) and we study how social expectations about the
evaluators affect the predictions of performance of job applicants. This study is run in the lab using the
GazePoint3HD eye-trackers. Our results show that when participants evaluate for themselves, they do
not discriminate towards women, but when evaluating for others, they present a negative biases towards
them. This effect is driven by both male and female evaluators.</p>

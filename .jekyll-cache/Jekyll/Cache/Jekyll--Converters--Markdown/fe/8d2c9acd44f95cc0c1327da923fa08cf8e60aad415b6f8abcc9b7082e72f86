I"¼<p>This project studies how information provision affects consumersâ€™ decisions regarding sustainability. Concerns about the environment have increased over the past few years. So has the consumersâ€™ intention to behave more â€˜sustainablyâ€™. Nonetheless, the value of sustainable products has not increased accordingly. One reason for this may be that it remains difficult for consumers to make sustainable decisions, due to continued ambiguity surrounding the sustainability of products. Multiple studies show how consumers are overwhelmed by the plethora of eco-labels in the market, how some of these labels are unreliable and how this, in turn, makes understanding the impact of their decisions quite a complicated task. Multiple governments and NGOs (e.g. Denmarkâ€™s government or â€˜Eaternityâ€™) are trying to develop universal and reliable labelling systems to ease the burden on consumers, but these are not yet easily available to consumers. Here, we study consumersâ€™ reactions to eco-labels that offer different distributions of sustainability ratings, reflecting different levels of environmental harm reduction. Specifically, in our experiment, we create an incentivized context that simulates online-shopping, where participants choose between products that differ in quality, sustainability ratings and price. We assess both the effect of the presence (vs absence) of information about sustainability ratings, reflecting naÃ¯ve and informed sustainable decisions; and the effect of different types of rating scales (linear vs non-linear) reflecting different rating systems that are currently in use in different markets. Moreover, we use visual-tracing methods (i.e. Mousetracking) to track how participants pay attention to different sources of information during decision-making. This allows us to infer the relative importance of product attributes during the decision-making process and to capture individual differences in the preferences of participants and the heterogeneity in treatment effects (see Engelmann, Hirmas, van der Weele, 2021). Our results will shed light on what information is relevant to provide to consumers and how we can help them make more sustainable decisions with greater ease.</p>

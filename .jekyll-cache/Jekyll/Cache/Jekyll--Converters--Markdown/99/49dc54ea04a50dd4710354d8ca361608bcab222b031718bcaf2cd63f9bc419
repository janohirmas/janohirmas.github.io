I"9<p>In this follow-up study from Engelmann et al. (2021), we take a closer look to the effects of exogenous variations in attention over the decision process. In our experiment, participants decide to accept or reject a series of mixed gambles. The two equally-likely outcomes, a gain and a loss, vary from trial to trial. The presentation durations (time one outcome is presented before switching to the other) also changes across trials. We analyze how these exogenous changes affect the decision process. We find weak evidence supporting a causal impact of the presentation durations over the relative importance of the outcomes (measured by loss aversion). A surprising result indicates that when gains are presented for longer, the participants decisionsâ€™ become more consistent (higher correlation between choice and the outcome values). We further explored whether this effect could be driven by the participants impulsiveness (measured by BIS-11; Patton et al. (1995)). Our results show that only impulsive participants become affected by the presentation durations.</p>

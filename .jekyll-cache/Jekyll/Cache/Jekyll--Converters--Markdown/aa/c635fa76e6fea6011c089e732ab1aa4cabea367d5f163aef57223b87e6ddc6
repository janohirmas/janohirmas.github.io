I"è<p>In this follow-up study from Engelmann et al. (2021), we take a closer look to the effects of exogenous variations in attention over the decision process. In our experiment, participants decide to accept or reject a series of mixed gambles. The two equally-likely outcomes, a gain and a loss, vary from trial to trial. The presentation durations (time one outcome is presented before switching to the other) also changes across trials. We analyze how these exogenous changes affect the decision process. We find weak evidence supporting a causal impact of the presentation durations over the relative importance of the outcomes (measured by loss aversion). A surprising result indicates that when gains are presented for longer, the participants decisionsâ€™ become more consistent (higher correlation between choice and the outcome values). We further explored whether this effect could be driven by the participants impulsiveness (measured by BIS-11; Patton et al. (1995)). Our results show that only impulsive participants become affected by the presentation durations.</p>

We study the effect of exogenous changes in visual attention on decisions of risk. Visual attention, namely, the process of filtering and selecting to focus on specific visual stimuli, plays a relevant role in the decision-making process Orquin and Mueller-Loose (2013). In a previous study Engelmann et al. (2021), we found a strong correlation between attention to different stimuli and their importance on the decision. Moreover, our results suggested that attention is both guided by the individualsâ€™ preferences and has a causal effect on them. In this study we test the causal effect of attention on the decision process. By using a new manipulation of attention, we find evidence that attention has a causal role on the decision process. Our results also show that the attention and its effect on the decision is different depending on the valence of the outcomes (gains or losses).</p>

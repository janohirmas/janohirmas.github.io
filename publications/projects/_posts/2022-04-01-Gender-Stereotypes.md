A signiffant gender gap in the labor market has been observed in almost ev-
ery country (World Economic Forum, 2021). Existing studies have shown that
gender differences in academic performance, career choices, and preferences can
partly explain the gender gap (Blau and Kahn, 2017). Women and men per-
form differently in several experimental tasks involving math, logic, and verbal
skills (e.g., Gneezy et al., 2003; Niederle and Vesterlund, 2010, 2011; Shurchkov,
2012). Additionally, several studies document the gender differences in compet-
itiveness, risk preferences, and social preferences (Croson and Gneezy, 2009).
These results suggest that payment schemes affect men and women differently.
Men are more responsive to competitive payment schemes (e.g., Gneezy et al.,
2003) whereas women are more responsive to pro-social incentives (e.g., Tonin
and Vlassopoulos, 2015). The goal of this project is to study whether payment
schemes can be used to tackle the gender gap in the labor market and lead to
more equality. We achieve this goal by answering three questions. Do payment
schemes affect the performance of men and women differently in a given task?
Do these payment schemes affect the beliefs about the genders' performance as
well? Finally, do these changes vary with the gender stereotype associated with
the task?

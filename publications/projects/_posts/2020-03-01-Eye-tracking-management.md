Behavioral strategy research aims to understand and improve strategic decision-
making processes by analyzing managersâ€™ psychological traits and cognitive activities. Our
work establishes a bridge between behavioral strategy and cognitive neuroscience by
performing an experimental design that uses eye-tracking analysis to understand the effect
of visual attention on heuristics about managerial decisions. Our experimental approach
allows researchers to show and quantify the effect of visual attention on repeated
managerial decisions. Our analysis identify some attentional sources of decision-making
efficiency, which are primarily driven by selectivity, as decision-makers learn to focus on
fewer pieces of information to make a managerial decision. Moreover, each of these pieces
of information is accessed fewer times as participants gain experience with the task. In
addition, we show that incorporating attentional information into a heuristic improves the
explanatory power of managerial decisions.

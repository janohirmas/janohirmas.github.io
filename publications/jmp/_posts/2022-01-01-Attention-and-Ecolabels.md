The European Union aims to become carbon-neutral by 2050. One of their new policies is to develop a sustainability rating to promote more sustainable consumption. However, it is still ambiguous how these ratings are going to affect consumers' decisions. We design an incentivized experiment in which participants make multiple decisions between two artificial products which vary in price, quality, and sustainability. The quality and sustainability of the products are presented in ratings, and we use different underlying rating systems for different treatment groups. In the middle of the experiment, some groups learn that both ratings increase linearly, while other groups learn that a linear rating while the other assumes a convex form. This information treatment allows us to explore how different ratings affect the decision. In addition to the choice data, we also record the information search (i.e. visual attention) to better understand how participants may have different decision processes. We find that if the consumers have no further information about the rating, consumers treat quality and sustainability ratings similarly, but when we incorporate the attention data, we find distinctive patterns of how quality and sustainability are approached. Moreover, after participants learn more about the ratings, their behaviour further differs between the ratings. When some sustainability products are less valuable, participants shift to both lower- and higher-sustainability products. In contrast, when the quality of a product becomes unappealing, we only observe shifts towards high-quality products. We conclude that ratings informing about the own benefit, i.e. quality, might be treated very differently from ratings about sustainability, and thus need to be carefully explained/designed to promote more sustainable consumption.

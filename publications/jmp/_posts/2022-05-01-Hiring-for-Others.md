In many hiring processes, job candidates are evaluated by intermediaries, such as HR personnel and/or external recruiters. These intermediaries evaluate the candidates based on CV and other information, and preselect the candidates which they expect to be hired by the hiring manager. However, to do so, intermediaries might not only take the skills of the candidate into account, but also potential biases of the hiring manager such as discrimination of a certain group. In this paper, we study how intermediaries form these beliefs and how they decide which candidates to forward to the hiring manager.

In two incentivized experiments, participants act as intermediaries in a selection process. They have to evaluate candidates that will be assessed by another participant who represents the hiring manager. The intermediaries observe information about the job candidate's application, such as gender, personality and aptitude tests. They also observe information about the hiring manager including their gender. We consistently find that intermediaries expect managers to display same-gender favoritism, instead of a systematic bias against either gender. In addition, we measure how participants allocate their attention to the candidates' information, i.e., gender and tests. We find strong correlations between the participants' allocated attention to an attribute and the extent to which they use it to make a decision. This is especially the case for the attention to gender and the managers' expected same-gender favoritism. Our results show that these (heterogeneous) intermediaries' expected same-gender favoritism can exacerbate discrimination in the hiring markets.

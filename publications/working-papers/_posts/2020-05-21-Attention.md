We study attentional processes underlying decision-making by directly recording visual fixation patterns that reflect attention towards specific choice options. In two experiments in which subjects choose whether to take a mixed gamble or not, we use eye-tracking to record the visual fixation patterns during decision-making that reflect moment-to-moment changes in visual attention. We assess the influence of attention on decision weights assigned to gains and losses of different magnitudes in the context of a random utility model (RUM). Importantly, we distinguish between two types of attention; average attention, reflecting behavioral goals and stable preferences, and trial-wise deviations from average attention, reflecting salient properties of gamble options on a given trial. Our results show significant relationships between both measures of attention and decision weights, indicating that both types of attention can influence choice, but do so differently. On the one hand, decision weights of gains and losses are strongly moderated by goal-based average attention, which also correlates with individual loss aversion parameters. On the other, trial-wise attentional deviations show a relationship with the saliency of gambles, which transfers to decision error proneness. These results suggest that, in the context of risky choice, attention is driven by both goal-oriented  (endogenous) and saliency-related (exogenous) factors, with average attention and trial-wise deviations influencing decision-making differentially and in specific ways. While average attention reflects stable economic preferences, such as loss aversion, trial-wise attentional deviations are related to the properties of the lottery and error proneness.

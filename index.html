      I finished my Research Master at <a href="https://www.tinbergen.nl/home">Tinbergen Institute</a> and I am soon to defend my PhD at Universiteit van Amsterdam. My Phd supervisors are <a href="https://www.uva.nl/profiel/e/n/j.b.engelmann/j.b.engelmann.html">Jan Engelmann</a> and <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/h/a/j.hausfeld/j.hausfeld.html">Jan Hausfeld</a>

      The focus of my research is understanding and measuring individuals heterogeneous behavior in economic decisions. During my PhD, I worked on experimental research trying to understand how people's attention process can help us understand differences in their behavior. My projects involve the usage of process-tracing methods such as Eye-tracking & MouselabWeb. My work covers multiple economic topics, including risky decisions, sustainable consumption and gender discrimination. Using novel statistical methods, I work on disentangling different channels on how attention plays a role in the decisions regarding these different economic contexts.

Hey Laury! <br><br>
I see you are still at home. I want you to prepare for this adventure!
I left you my backpack with all the things you will need for your travels. 
Just make sure you have clothes to spend the night. A good adventurer is always prepared! 

<br><br>

Are you Ready? Good! Let's start. <br><br>

First, I need you to visit an old friend of mine. It lives in Noord as well. 
It is quite exotic, has brazen skin and it always greets us when we go climbing. 
<br><br>

Is it a plane? Nope, and it's also not superman.

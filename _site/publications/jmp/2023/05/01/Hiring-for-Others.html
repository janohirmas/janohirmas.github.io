<p>We examine the role of intermediaries in the hiring process, such as head hunters and recruitment agencies, and how these intermediaries may contribute to discrimination based on (biased) beliefs about the employers. For most large corporations, there are typically two approaches to hiring: standardized processes managed by the HR department or the outsourcing of this responsibility to recruitment agencies or headhunters. These intermediaries play a crucial role by providing the employer with a curated list, recommendations, or ratings of job applicants. <br />
However, intermediaries might not only consider which applicant is a good fit for the job, but also whether the applicant matches the firm’s “taste”. Intermediaries are driven to find candidates who are more likely to be hired, and as a result, they might anticipate and perpetuate discrimination in the recruitment and selection processes if they expect managers to engage in discriminatory practices. <br />
In our research, we conduct three pre-registered experiments to explore how intermediaries predict the performance of job candidates depending on who evaluates them. Using a database from Kausel et al. (2012), we developed an incentivized paradigm where participants had to evaluate real candidates in a job application process based on information obtained during the application process. Specifically, participants observe standardized scores of candidates’ General Mental Ability, Conscientiousness (from Big 5), the score on an unstructured interview and the gender of the candidate. Additionally, we add a random score that is completely unrelated to the actual selection process and participants are aware of this. The candidates in our sample were all hired by the company and they had a performance evaluation three months after being hired. <br />
In our first experiment, we compared how participants predicted the performance of the different candidates and how they expected others to make the same predictions (first-order beliefs). Participants observed all the candidate’s characteristics and then predicted their performance ratings. We recorded their visual attention using a Gazepoint 3 HD eye-tracker. Participants rate 32 candidates with different attribute compositions. After participants have rated all candidates, we ask them to predict how other people, that performed this experiment before, rated the same candidates. We incentivize their beliefs using the method from Krupka &amp; Weber (2013). Our pre-registered hypotheses were that (1) individuals predict differently compared to what they expect others to do (2) any changes in the relative weighting of the different attributes will be accompanied by a shift in attention to said attributes.  <br />
Our results show that participants do not discriminate when predicting performance, but do expect that others will discriminate against women. Additionally, we find that differences in the relative weighting of the different attributes is correlated with their level of attention. <br />
In our second experiment, we explore further whether the expected bias coming from others depends on the others’ individual characteristics. In this experiment, we use a modification of the previous paradigm. We present participants with the information of one candidate and ask them for their predictions of how six previous participants (evaluators) scored that given candidate. The six evaluators differ themselves on their gender (Man/Woman) and their level of their math skills, measured by the Berlin numeracy task (divided into high, mid or low math skills). Our pre-registered hypotheses is that participants will predict differently (i.e. different relative weights to the attributes) for men and women; and for the different math skills. <br />
The results show an expected bias towards women for all six evaluators, replicating our results from the first experiment. Moreover, we find that (1) men are expected to show a greater bias against women and (2) people with high math skills (compared to mid and low) put a higher weight on general mental ability (capacity to process information such as graphs and tables). These results are consistent with in-group out-group behaviour. Post-hoc analyses show that participants expect that others with their same gender will have less of an in-group bias than the opposite gender. <br />
We are currently developing our third experiment, which is based on the results of our second experiment. In this experiment, we use a similar paradigm to the one in our first experiment. In this experiment, participants will predict the evaluations of multiple candidates for only one evaluator at the time (second-order beliefs). After participants have answered their second-order beliefs for one candidate, we subsequently ask them about the same candidates for a different evaluator. The aim of this experiment is twofold. First, we want to do a confirmatory analysis for the results found in study two. Namely, are men and women expected to predict differently for other men and women? Do people expect higher math-skill evaluators to overweight the general mental ability when compared to evaluators with lower math skills? We will also further explore our exploratory results: do women (compared to men) and high-skilled math participants (compared to low-skilled) predict less in-group biases? <br />
Secondly, by using eye-trackers, we aim to trace the participants behaviour and answer in this case whether (1) more attention to an attribute correlates with a higher weight of said attribute on the decision; and (2) is there a shift in attentional focus when the participants predict for different evaluators? <br />
Our current and future results inform about the role of intermediaries in the hiring markets; and how intermediaries can enhance the levels of discrimination in said market. We also provide insightful information of whether shifts in attention are able to predict shifts in behaviour.</p>

<p>In many hiring processes, job candidates are evaluated by intermediaries, such as human-resources personnel and/or external recruiters. These intermediaries evaluate the candidates based on CVs and other information, and preselect the candidates which they expect to be hired by the hiring manager. As a result, intermediaries might preselect a biased pool of candidates if they are influenced by their expectations about the hiring manager’s preferences, potentially including (unwarranted) discriminatory biases. We designed two incentivized experiments, where participants act as intermediaries and predict how a hiring manager will evaluate candidates based on both job-relevant measures (e.g., aptitude and personality tests) and seemingly irrelevant factors such as gender. Importantly, they also observe information about the hiring manager including their gender, age and math skills, allowing us to test whether intermediaries differentially evaluate candidates depending on who they are hiring for. We consistently find that intermediaries expect managers to prefer candidates of the same gender as the manager (expected same-gender favoritism). Furthermore, by tracing the intermediaries’ visual attention, we find that intermediaries who expect more same-gender favoritism, also look longer at the candidates’ gender information. Accordingly, given the overrepresentation of men in managerial roles, these results on expected same-gender favoritism highlight a novel mechanism in which discrimination takes place in the labor market.</p>

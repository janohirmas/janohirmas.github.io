<p>This meta-analysis investigates the value of algorithmic and human advice in decision-making processes. Specifically, it examines three core aspects: preference, adherence, and performance. First, we assess whether individuals exhibit a preference for advice originating from algorithms versus real people, exploring factors that might influence trust and reliance on one source over the other. Second, we evaluate the degree to which recipients follow or deviate from the advice provided by algorithms compared to human advisors, analyzing patterns in adherence. Lastly, we measure the impact of algorithmic advice on user performance, determining whether algorithmic guidance leads to improved decision outcomes relative to human advice. By synthesizing findings across studies, this analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the conditions under which algorithmic advice may be preferred, adhered to, and beneficial for enhancing performance in various contexts.</p>
